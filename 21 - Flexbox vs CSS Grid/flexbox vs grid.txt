Pros of flexbox:
-> better browser support than grid
-> can be animated as flex-grow whereas, the only thing that can be animated in grid is gap.
-> the disadvantage of grid is that the columns are rigid. therefore the same column width applies to every row.
   this is not the case with flexbox. refer stacked-layout-FINISHED.html

Pros of grid:
-> we dont have justify items and justify-self, whereas this is present in grid. 
   we cannot do things like stick 4 items, one to each corner of the container in flexbox.
-> its much more consistent across all the browsers and there's not as many bugs as flexbox has.
-> easier to transition from single axis to 2 dimensions
